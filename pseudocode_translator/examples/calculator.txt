Create a Calculator class that:
- has a result attribute that starts at 0
- has an add method that adds a number to result
- has a subtract method that subtracts a number from result
- has a multiply method that multiplies result by a number
- has a divide method that divides result by a number
  - if dividing by zero, raise ValueError with message "Cannot divide by zero"
- has a clear method that resets result to 0
- has a get_result method that returns the current result
- has a calculate method that takes a string expression like "2 + 3 * 4"
  - parse and evaluate the expression
  - support +, -, *, / operators
  - follow order of operations (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction)
  - update result with the calculated value
  - return the calculated value
