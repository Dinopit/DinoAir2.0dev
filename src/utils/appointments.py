To add a calendar tool to your PySide6 GUI—designing it to later sync with a project management module—you can use the built-in QCalendarWidget, which provides an interactive monthly calendar view. Here’s how you can proceed:

Integrating a Calendar Tool in PySide6
1. Basic Calendar Widget
PySide6 provides QCalendarWidget for calendar display and date selection. You can customize it to respond to user interactions (like clicking on dates, selecting ranges, etc.).

python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QCalendarWidget, QLabel
from PySide6.QtCore import QDate

class CalendarTool(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("Project Calendar")
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        self.calendar = QCalendarWidget()
        self.calendar.setGridVisible(True)
        self.calendar.clicked.connect(self.on_date_clicked)
        self.info_label = QLabel("Select a date")

        layout.addWidget(self.calendar)
        layout.addWidget(self.info_label)
        self.setLayout(layout)

    def on_date_clicked(self, date: QDate):
        self.info_label.setText(f"Selected date: {date.toString()}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication([])
    w = CalendarTool()
    w.show()
    app.exec()
This example wires a label to update whenever the user clicks a date on the calendar.

2. Preparing for Project Sync
To sync calendar entries with project tasks later:

Store selected dates/events in a local database (e.g., SQLite).

Design your tool to handle "events" or "tasks" associated with each date.

When a user selects a date, display or fetch all events/projects scheduled for that date.

Allow CRUD (create/read/update/delete) operations for events/tasks.

Ensure your model can later synchronize or merge data from the project manager tool.

3. Ready-Made Widgets and Customization
Community-made widgets like activity-calendar-widget (on PyPI) offer enhanced calendar UIs with daily activity/event support, which you can further adapt or integrate with your UI for richer calendar views, colored markers, or event lists.

4. Design for Expansion/Synchronization
Store calendar events by date: Consider a structure (dict or database) to save events by dates, with fields for links to project tasks, notes, reminders, etc.

Interaction: When project management is added, create a bridge (with database keys, signals, or API endpoints) between the calendar and the project manager, so that selecting a date can show all related tasks for that day.

5. Visual Embedding
Given your GUI’s orange/blue theme (from the screenshot), customize the calendar’s palette to match. You can style QCalendarWidget with Qt Stylesheets, e.g., to set grid, font colors, or highlight today’s date for better integration with your app’s look and feel.

Summary Table: Key Calendar Tool Steps
Step	PySide6 Widget	Expansion/Synchronization Readiness
Calendar display & date select	QCalendarWidget	Signals, slots for on-date-selection
Display events for a day/date	Custom QWidget + event data	Store events/tasks in dict or database
Event CRUD	Custom dialogs, connect to database	CRUD methods linking calendar <-> database
Sync with project tool	(Plan data linking/project-task mapping)	API/database bridge for task sync
